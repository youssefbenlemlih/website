      A Word From Me...
    </Text>
    <br />
    <br />
    My name is Youssef and I have been tinkering with Frontend Development for{" "}
    <u>the last 5 years</u>.
    <br />
    <br />
    Frontend brings me joy, but I often found myself <b>struggling</b> with some
    stuff like:
    <br />
    <br />
    <ul>
      <li>Layouting, finding good fonts, choosing icons...</li>
      <li>
        Tedious tasks, like Regular Expressions, tweaking CSS shadows or
        creating color swatches from scratch...
      </li>
      <li>Keeping up with the latest JavaScript / React news...</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    So I decided to put all the accumulated knowledge of the last years into one
    place.
    <br />
    <br />
    <Text fw={600} component={"span"}>
      This is what I wish I had, when I was just getting started.
    </Text>
    <br />
    <br />
    Best of luck and enjoy the journey!

A new year is a chance for a new start.

So why not try something new?

In 2025, I can start writing down and **sharing** my thoughts.

Sure, l've been sporadically writing down the unorganized "thought-spaghetti" in my notebook, but maybe sharing them could be interesting as well.

Maybe people can relate to what I am thinking.

What the hell, *someone may even find it useful* (Now I'm officially getting ahead of myself...).

Since I already have a [personal website setup](https://github.com/youssefbenlemlih/) website, adding a new collection is as easy as copy/pasting folders.

To make the whole process easier I also setup Obsidian with Git on my iPhone, that way I can **write and publish on the go**.

Until next time, happy new year.

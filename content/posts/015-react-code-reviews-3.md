The third episode of the React Code Review series, where I provide feedback on your React projects.

This covers React &
TypeScript topics, including the useCallback hook, TypeScript discriminated union, TypeScript declaration files, Enums
vs string literals and other improvements like the use of Generics.

I also explain how to fix these problems, to help you avoid them in your own code.

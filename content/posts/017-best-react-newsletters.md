Keeping up with latest React News can be time-consuming.

Luckily there are a few newsletter that deliver the latest news in your inbox regularly.

So here are the **Best React Newsletters**, that I personally recommend.

## #1 This Week In React

[This Week In React](https://thisweekinreact.com/) is one of the best newsletters out there.

It covers the _latest_ React and React Native news **on a weekly basis**.

It's perfect for **intermediate / advanced** developers.

## #2 Next.js Weekly

One of my favourites, [Next.js Weekly](https://nextjsweekly.com/) is a **high quality newletter**.

Not only is it visually appealing, it includes a good mix of Tutorials, Articles, Opinions, as well as Packages, Tools and Repos.

## #3 React Newsletter

[React Newsletter](https://reactnewsletter.com/) is a **weekly** newsletter that keeps it simple:

Just a **good curated list** of links for you to read.

Definitely worth a checking out.

## #4 React Status

While [React Status](https://react.statuscode.com/) doesn't always cover the latest news, it's always **interesting to
read**.

The newsletter is in the form of a **weekly roundup** of the latest React and React Native **links and tutorials**.

## #5 Bytes

[Bytes](https://bytes.dev/) is one of **the most popular Newsletters**.

It doesn't just cover React but also the **JavaScript ecosystem**.

It's a **bi-weekly** newsletter that is definitely worth a read.

## #6 React Digest

As the name suggests, [React Digest](https://reactdigest.net/) is carefully **curated weekly newsletter** for React developers.

Each week focuses on **just 5 interesting links**.

This one is perfect for those is a hurry.

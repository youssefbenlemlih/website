Hey there,

In case you didn't already know, React's style prop comes with a lot of problems.

It has:

no support for hover styles, or responsive design,
performance issues, and
it easily clutters up your code.
So I made a 4-minute video explaining 4 better approaches to style your app in React.

I also go over how to choose the perfect approach for your React appâ€¦ so you don't want to miss it!

You can watch it now on YouTube ðŸ‘‡

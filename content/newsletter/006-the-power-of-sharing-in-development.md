Hey, it's Youssef again,

One of the most impactful decisions I’ve made in my career is embracing **sharing**.

Whether it’s sharing knowledge or code, this simple act has shaped my journey and brought immense rewards.

In today’s issue, I want to share why sharing is so transformative and how you can start making an impact in the
developer world. Let’s dive in!

## Teaching React to Backend Developers

At one of my previous jobs, I was a fullstack developer when I got the opportunity to teach React to my backend
colleagues.

That experience sparked something in me—an unexpected joy from teaching.

It wasn't enough to stop there, though.

I thought, *Why not teach React to more people in my free time?* And that’s how my YouTube journey began.

## Starting a YouTube Channel 🎥

If someone had told me I’d reach 1,000 YouTube subscribers in just a year of part-time content creation,

I wouldn't have believed them—but apparently people care about what I have to say about React.

Starting a YouTube channel has been life-changing.

- **Confidence boost:** Teaching others has improved my confidence in my full-time role as an IT consultant.
- **Deeper learning:** When you teach, you notice the nuances. Every tutorial I make helps me learn more about the
  topic, even when I think I’ve already mastered it.
- **Personal growth:** Oh, the grammar errors and mispronunciations in those early videos! it may not seem like it, but
  I cut a LOT of mumbling out of each video. Seriously tho, creating content has pushed me to improve in ways I didn’t
  expect.

## Open-Sourcing My Blog ✨

One of my recent ‘adventures in sharing’ has
been [open-sourcing my personal blog](https://github.com/youssefbenlemlih/website).

Instead of fearing that someone might “steal” my work, I realized the truth: people are inspired by what you share.

Open-sourcing projects can be a great way to contribute, learn, and connect with the community.

## Face Your Fears & Start Small 🛠️

Sharing doesn't always mean launching a big project. You can start small:

- Answer questions on Reddit or Stack Overflow.
- Share a helpful script on GitHub Gist.
- Open-source a side project or tool you’ve built.

So think about one way you can give back to the dev world this week. What small step can you take to share your
knowledge or work?

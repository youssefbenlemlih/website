One of the biggest challenges I faced when learning React, is to keep up with the latest changes.

Things are evolving at a superfast pace.

And keeping track of the latest news (and filtering out the noise) can be draining.

But it doesn't have to be that way.

There are newsletters that share the best (and relevant) React news, that makes it easy to stay up-to-date.

So I made a blog post contain the Best React Newsletters, that I personally read.

You can check it out here ðŸ‘‡
